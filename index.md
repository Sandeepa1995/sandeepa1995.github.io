##  Quick Summary

I'm a PhD student in [Computer Science at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/), working in the intersection of machine learning and optimizations/compilers. My thesis is focused on [GALA](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3763113): a GNN Domain Specific Language (DSL) and Compiler that can combine and explore optimizations at multiple granularities.

I'm advised by [Prof. Charith Mendis](https://charithmendis.com/) and am part of the [ADAPT](https://adapt.cs.illinois.edu/) group. I got my BSc. degree in [Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka](https://cse.mrt.ac.lk/).
